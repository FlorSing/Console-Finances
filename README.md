# Console-Finances

Hi. 

This repository contains files for the financial records of a company.

It presents a simple analysis using JavaScript. The output will be published on GitHub pages.  

Please note: The output can be viewed on the console developer tool of the webpage (using [Ctrl+Shift+i] from Windows).

A print screen of the output is sampled below:
